                                                      Emotion Detection Project
Project Overview

This project is focused on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately detect human emotions from facial expressions in real-time. It leverages TensorFlow and OpenCV to classify emotions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. Additionally, it assesses stress levels based on the detected emotions. This README outlines the project setup, model architecture, and instructions for running the application.

Features

Real-time emotion detection using webcam feed.
Stress level indication based on the emotion detected.
